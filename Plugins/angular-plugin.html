  AngularJS 1.0.0
  --------------------
  
  This version of AngularJS is now a merge of the following two packages:
  AngularJS - http://deansofer.com/projects/view/74/AngularJs_tmbundle
  AngularJS Attributes Completion - http://subhaze.github.io/angularjs-attributes
  
  This new package provides similar functionality of the two but with added features and options.
  
  Some of the added features are:
  - Quick Panel search of directives/controllers/filters/etc...
  - GoTo definition for directives
  - GoToDocs for core AngularJS directives
  - Directive completions for your custom defined directives
